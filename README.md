## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. ✅
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices. ✅
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice. ✅
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid. ✅
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid). ✅
- Toggle light and dark mode. ✅
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app). ✅
- **My Addition #1**: I added a confirm modal for changing invoice status ✅
- **My Addition #2**: Clicking outside the modals will close the modal ✅
- **My Addition #3**: I added a rate limter to prevent generating more than 5 draft invoice per minute ✅
