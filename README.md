## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. ✅
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices. ✅
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice. ✅
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid. ✅
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid). ✅
- Toggle light and dark mode. ✅
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app). ✅
- **My Addition #1**: I added a confirm modal for changing invoice status ✅
- **My Addition #2**: Clicking outside the modals will close the modal ✅
- **My Addition #3**: I added a rate limter to prevent generating more than 5 draft invoice per minute ✅

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.
